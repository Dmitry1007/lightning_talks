# The Benefits Of Taking Cold Showers
## known as the James Bond Shower

### Before we get into the actual benefits of cold showers, let’s establish the simple fact that hot showers are a luxury and not a necessity. Throughout most of human history, people had to bathe in whatever water was available to them. And before I talk about the many benefits of taking cold showers, let's take a look at some people who have benefited from exposing themselves to cold stuff.

#### Cold Adaptation
##### In Sweden, it’s common practice to let small babies take naps outdoors in the cold. It has been shown that these babies end up more resistant to disease and that they sleep deeper and more soundly.

This might be because after the initial shock of the shower, your body calms down and relaxes very deeply. In Siberia, they take it one step further and dump a whole bucket of cold water over children’s heads in a ritual called Rodnichok or cold springs. They do this year-round for children between the ages of two and six. Again, this is in Siberia. These kids are tough. It’s been shown that about 95% of the kids who participate are healthy through the flu season. In Russia and most scandinavian countries people often Sauna and jump into ice cold pools, reservoirs, creeks, or even roll around in snow. My father's 66 and I honestly can't remember the last time he had a cold or flu.

#### Improves Immunity And Circulation
##### According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a well known alternative health expert, cold water can improve circulation by encouraging blood to surround our organs, which can then help combat some problems of the heart. When our bodies are exposed to cold temperatures, our bodies respond by pumping blood to our organs. This can also lower blood pressure, if you're one of the millions of people who suffer from high blood pressure. It could also clear blocked arteries. So all of these things lead to a stronger immune system.

#### Refines Hair And Skin
##### Hot water has the tendency to dry out our skin. That's why many people who are dependent on hot showers also depend on moisturizers, and don't get me started with the amount of chemicals in those lotions. A healthy body doesn't need to shmeer itself with goop. You're skin should be able to produce the oils it needs. Cold water keeps your pores and cuticles tight, which leads to a better complection and shiner hair. 


#### Inflamation Decrease
##### Why do you think athletes from pretty much every sport put ice packs on their aching joins and even sit in ice cold tubs for up to 10min? Cold does two things to your body: It decreases inflamation and increases circulation. When you're system is flushed with nutrient rich blood muscle and tendons begin to repair themselves.  

#### Releives Stress
##### Cold showers can stimulate noradrenaline secretion in the brain, which is associated with improving mood disorders like depression. Taking a cold shower sends an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which can result in an anti-depressive effect. So, if you need a pick-me-up, jump in the shower and turn it to the blast setting. [link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17993252)

#### Better breathing 
##### You may hyperventilate as soon as you get in a cold shower, which is a pretty natural response. However, the panic will only make the experience worse so it is in your best interest to breathe calmly and deeply. Few people breathe deeply so you may need cold showers to get some fresh oxygen to the far corners of your body.

#### Inner Strenght 
##### Besides the biological health benefits of taking cold showers, there's also a powerful psycological aspect. Becoming comfortable in an uncomfortable sitution prepares us for many of lifes challenges. But I challenge you to expose yourself to 5-min of healthy uncomfort every day and I bet you that will power will rub off into many other aspects of your life. By choosing to inflict dis-comfot upon yourself every day, we become more gritty and less wimpy and fragile.

#### Energy Increase
##### Besides the fact that there’s nothing quite like ice cold water to wake you up, cold showers can actually boost your energy levels. When you jump into a cold shower, the nerve endings in your skin start to fire. Your heart starts racing and you start breathing rapidly as your body adjusts. That’s a response that the best cup of coffee in the world can’t beat.

#### Lymphatic Movement
##### Your lymphatic system takes waste away from your cells to help you fight disease. It’s separate from your blood vessels, but it’s moved around by the contraction of your muscles. Cold showers cause your entire body to contract and this forces your lymphatic system to push lymph fluids throughout your body, stopping them from pooling in one part of your body as they would if the lymphatic system were compromised or inefficient.
