## The Benefits Of Taking Cold Showers

### Cold Adaptation
In Sweden and Finland, it’s common practice to let small babies take naps outdoors in the cold. It has been shown that these babies end up more resistant to disease and that they sleep deeper and more soundly. [link](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21537988)

In Siberia and most of Russia, they take it one step further and dump a whole bucket of cold water over children’s heads in a ritual called Rodnichok or cold springs. They do this year-round for children between the ages of two and six. Again, this is in Siberia. These kids are tough. It’s been shown that about 95% of the kids who participate are healthy through the flu season.

In Russia and most scandinavian countries people often Sauna and jump into ice cold pools, reservoirs, creeks, or even roll around in snow.

###So what are the actual benefits?

#### Improves Immunity And Circulation
According to Dr. Joseph Mercola, a well known alternative health expert, cold water can improve circulation by encouraging blood to surround our organs, which can then help combat some problems of the heart. This can also lower blood pressure, if you're one of the millions of people who suffer from high blood pressure. It could also clear blocked arteries.

#### Lymphatic Movement
Your lymphatic system carries waste away from your cells to help you fight disease. Cold showers cause your entire body to contract and this forces your lymphatic system to push lymph fluids throughout your body, stopping them from pooling in one place.

#### Refines Hair And Skin
Hot water has the tendency to dry out our skin. That's why many people who are dependent on hot showers also depend on moisturizers. Cold water keeps your pores and cuticles tight, which leads to a better complection and shiner hair.

#### Decreases Inflamation
Why do you think athletes from pretty much every sport put ice packs on their aching joins and even sit in ice cold tubs for up to 10min? Cold does two things to your body: It decreases inflamation and increases circulation. When you're system is flushed with nutrient rich blood, muscle and tendons begin to repair themselves.

#### Releives Stress
Cold showers can stimulate noradrenaline secretion in the brain, which is associated with improving mood disorders like depression. Taking a cold shower sends an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which can result in an anti-depressive effect.

#### Energy Increase
When you jump into a cold shower, the nerve endings in your skin start to fire. Your heart starts racing and you start breathing rapidly as your body adjusts. That’s a response that the best cup of coffee in the world can’t beat.

#### Inner Strenght
Besides the biological health benefits of taking cold showers, there's also a powerful psycological aspect. Becoming comfortable in an uncomfortable setting prepares us for many of lifes challenges. I challenge you to expose yourself to 5-min of healthy uncomfort every day and I bet it's going to seep into other aspects of your life. By choosing to inflict dis-comfot upon yourself every day, we become more gritty and less wimpy and fragile.
